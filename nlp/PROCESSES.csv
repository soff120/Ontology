60, control risks, Inputs, Project Management Plan,project management plan includes risk management plan provides guidance risk monitoring controlling.
61, control risks, Inputs, risk register,risk register has key inputs include identified risks risk owners agreed-upon risk responses control actions assessing effectiveness response plans risk responses specific implementation actions symptoms warning signs risk residual secondary risks a watch list low-priority risks time cost contingency reserves. watch list is within risk register provides a list low-priority project management institute. a guide project management body knowledge (pmbok® guide) – fifth edition licensed jorge diego fuentes sanchez pmi memberid copy is a pmi member benefit not distribution sale - project risk management
62, control risks, Inputs, Work Performance data,work performance data related various performance results possibly impacted risks includes is not limited deliverable status schedule progress costs incurred.
63, control risks, Inputs, Work Performance reports,work performance reports take information performance measurements analyze provide project work performance information including variance analysis earned value data forecasting data. data points could be impactful controlling performance related risks.
64, control risks, tools and techniques, risk reassessment,control risks often results identification new risks reassessment current risks closing risks are outdated. project risk reassessments should be regularly scheduled. amount detail repetition are appropriate depends project progresses relative objectives.
65, control risks, tools and techniques, risk Audits,risk audits examine document effectiveness risk responses dealing identified risks root causes as well as effectiveness risk management process. project manager is responsible ensuring risk audits are performed appropriate frequency as defined project’s risk management plan. risk audits may be included routine project review meetings team may choose hold separate risk audit meetings. format audit objectives should be clearly defined audit is project management institute. a guide project management body knowledge (pmbok® guide) – fifth edition jorge diego fuentes sanchez pmi memberid copy is a pmi member benefit not distribution sale - project risk management
66, control risks, tools and techniques, Variance and trend Analysis,many control processes employ variance analysis compare planned results actual results. purposes controlling risks trends project’s execution should be reviewed using performance information. earned value analysis other methods project variance trend analysis may be used monitoring overall project performance. outcomes analyses may forecast potential deviation project completion cost schedule targets. deviation baseline plan may indicate potential impact threats opportunities.
67, control risks, tools and techniques, technical Performance Measurement,technical performance measurement compares technical accomplishments project execution schedule technical achievement. requires definition objective quantifiable measures technical performance can be used compare actual results targets. such technical performance measures may include weight transaction times number delivered defects storage capacity etc. deviation such as demonstrating less functionality planned a milestone can help forecast degree success achieving project’s scope.
68, control risks, tools and techniques, reserve Analysis,throughout execution project some risks may occur positive negative impacts budget schedule contingency reserves. reserve analysis compares amount contingency reserves remaining amount risk remaining time project order determine remaining reserve is adequate.
69, control risks, tools and techniques, Meetings,project risk management should be agenda item periodic status meetings. amount time required item will vary depending upon risks have been identified priority difficulty response. often risk management is practiced easier becomes. frequent discussions risk make likely people will identify risks project management institute. a guide project management body knowledge (pmbok® guide) – fifth edition licensed jorge diego fuentes sanchez pmi memberid copy is a pmi member benefit not distribution sale - project risk management
70, control risks, outputs, Work Performance Information,work performance information as a control risks output provides a mechanism communicate support project decision making.
71, control risks, outputs, change requests,implementing contingency plans workarounds sometimes results a change request. change requests are prepared submitted perform integrated change control process (section change requests can include recommended corrective preventive actions as well. recommended corrective actions. are activities realign performance project work project management plan. include contingency plans workarounds. latter are responses were not initially planned are required deal emerging risks were previously unidentified accepted passively. recommended preventive actions. are activities ensure future performance project work is aligned project management plan.
72, control risks, outputs, Project Management Plan updates,approved change requests have effect risk management processes corresponding component documents project management plan are revised reissued reflect approved changes. elements project management plan may be updated are same as plan risk responses project management institute. a guide project management body knowledge (pmbok® guide) – fifth edition jorge diego fuentes sanchez pmi memberid copy is a pmi member benefit not distribution sale - project risk management
73, control risks, outputs, Project documents updates,project documents may be updated as a result control risk process include are not limited risk register. risk register updates may include outcomes risk reassessments risk audits periodic risk reviews. outcomes may include identification new risks updates probability impact priority response plans ownership other elements risk register. outcomes can also include closing risks are no longer applicable releasing associated reserves. actual outcomes project’s risks risk responses. information can help project managers plan risk throughout organizations as well as future projects.
74, control risks, outputs, organizational Process Assets updates,risk management processes produce information may be used future projects should be captured organizational process assets. organizational process assets may be updated include are not limited totemplates risk management plan including probability impact matrix risk registerrisk breakdown structure lessons learned project risk management activities.these documents should be updated as needed project closure. final versions risk register risk management plan templates checklists risk breakdown structure are included.
